Click or tap on screen to create dots.
click space button to stop or start the windmill rotation
click the start button to do the same things

saw this video and wanted to make a simulation that runs on modern browsers and mobile so I made it into a PWA

this program is inspired by the IMO 2011 second problem, that states: 

 Let S be a finite set of at least two points in the plane. Assume that no three
 points of S are collinear. A windmill is a process that starts with a line going
 through a single point P S. The line rotates clockwise about the pivot P until
 the first time that the line meets some other point belonging to S. This point, Q,
 takes over as the new pivot, and the line now rotates clockwise about Q, until it
 next meets a point of S. This process continues indefinitely.
 Show that we can choose a point P in S and a line going through P such that
 the resulting windmill uses each point of S as a pivot infinitely many times.

 made with some modifications, here, you can create the points, the line is already turning
